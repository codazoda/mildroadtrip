#Mild Road Trip

[Mild Road Trip](http://www.mildroadtrip.com) is a blog about getting out on 
the open road regardless of your budget or time restrictions. It's about 
planning road trips that take less time than watching a movie at home and cost 
less than going on a movie date.

My goal for this blog is to share my own road trip experiences and to inspire 
you to discover your surroundings by taking epic trips of your own. I'll write 
about things that will help you plan, pack, and get on the road.

## Posting

Each time I post I need to do the following.

- Write the post and push it
- Remember, posts are usually scheduled
- Run `jekyll serve` or `jekyll serve --future` to test the site
- Post on instagram @mildroadtrip
- Post on Twitter @mildroadtrip
- Post trip video on [Mild Road Trip](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4ek7noEAwQZX6SoqnI14_g) YouTube Channel
- Keyword research data is in my notes repo

## Updating

In order to have github regenerate the site, and display pages that should now be loaded, the project needs to be updated and pushed. I have a modified.txt file that I use for the purpose.

    date > modified.txt

Then add and commit.
