#Mild Road Trip

[Mild Road Trip](http://www.mildroadtrip.com) is a blog about getting out on 
the open road regardless of your budget or time restrictions. It's about 
planning road trips that take less time than watching a movie at home and cost 
less than going on a movie date.

My goal for this blog is to share my own road trip experiences and to inspire 
you to discover your surroundings by taking epic trips of your own. I'll write 
about things that will help you plan, pack, and get on the road.
