#Mild Road Trip

Mild Road Trip is a blog about getting out on the open road regardless of your 
budget or time restrictions. It's about planning road trips that take less time 
than watching a movie at home and cost less than going on a movie date.

My goal for this blog is to share my own road trip experiences and to inspire 
you to discover your surroundings by taking epic trips of your own. I'll write 
about things that will help you plan, pack, and get on the road.
