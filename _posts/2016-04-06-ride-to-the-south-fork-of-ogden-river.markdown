It was my birthday and I took the day off and decided to take a ride to 
the South Fork campground along the South fork of the Ogden River. Through 
Ogden Canyon splitting the Wasatch Mountains in Northern Utah.

I was nervous. Had second thoughts about whether I should go or not. But, if 
you want adventure you've got to get over your nerves and just do it.

As I went up the canyon it got colder and colder. I stopped at Chris' to warm 
up and change to my warmer gloves. I was about two thirds of the way to my 
destination. I had thoughts about turning around here. I started thinking that 
I was already cold but that I had the entire ride home left. Turning around 
might be a good idea. But, as I sat in the parking lot for a few minutes, I 
warmed up quickly. I decided to push on and complete the ride I had set out 
to complete.

On the way up, I noticed my odometer would be at about 100 miles when I got to 
South Fork. I needed to look at it, take note, and capture a photo of the 
bike going into triple digits.

I got to South Fork, parked, and took a few pictures.

On the way down, I looked at the ODO. Oops, I had forgotten to take that 
picture. But, my calculations were a little off and I wasn't at 100 miles yet.
I would let it roll around and then stop at the safest point after that. I got 
to the Magpie sign and pulled off onto the tiny shoulder. Snapped a quick
picture, and got back on the road.
