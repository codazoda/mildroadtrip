Welcome to Mild Road Trip! This is a blog about getting out on the open road 
regardless of your budget or time restrictions. It's about planning road trips 
that take less time than watching a movie at home and cost less than going on a 
movie date.

My goal for this blog is to share my own road trip experiences and to inspire 
you to discover your surroundings by taking epic trips of your own. I'll write 
about things that will help you plan, pack, and get on the road.
