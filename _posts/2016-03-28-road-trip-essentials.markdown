If you're going on a road trip you'll need a few road trip essentials. You can save money by packing what you need in advance.

## Snacks

First, you'll need road trip snacks. Almost any road trip needs snacks, even local trips.

## Hammock Hanging

A great thing to do on small road trips is get into hanging a hammock. You can hang a hammock for day trips or overnight trips. I love lounging in my [Grand Trunk hammock](http://amzn.to/1UxGRDe) and it doesn't cost very much. Visit a park or a hiking trail and hang your hammock for a few hours. You'll really enjoy your stay in a hammock.

## Overnight Camping

If you are going to do some overnight camping, you'll need more gear. You'll probably want to start with a tent, a sleeping pad, and a sleeping bag; at a minimum.  A blanket for extra warmth is also a good idea.

You'll probably want to pack some cleaning supplies. Washcloths, a hand towel, wet wipes, and hand sanitizer are all inexpensive options that you could go with. A washcloth and a hand towel can go a long way. Wet wipes and hand sanitizer are easy alternatives that don't require any washing.

## Road Trip Ideas

Once you have the essentials, here are a few road trip ideas to get you started. You could visit parks or landmarks in your area. You could also pick up an outdoor sport like hiking or fishing.

You could also visit something interesting near you. Make a plan to visit and collect pictures of your car next to all the train bridges within 50 miles of your home.

Plan a route 66 road trip and go all out. Stay in a hotel or take all your camping gear and camp along the way.
