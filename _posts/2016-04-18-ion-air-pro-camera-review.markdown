I purchased the [iON Air Pro Lite Wifi Camera](http://amzn.to/1RRndlH) to use as
a dash cam on my motorcycle. I'm sure it would work just as well in a car
windshield or on a bicycle.

I purchased it because it's really inexpensive and I wanted a cheap camera 
to get started capturing my rides. I'll probably buy more camera's in the 
future.

It has a 170 degree viewing angle and two resolution modes. The resolution 
options are 1080p at 30 frames per second and 720p at 60 frames per second. For 
motorcycle riding, I plan to use the 720p 60fps setting to eliminate the 
effects of the bike shaking and to allow me to do better slow motion.

## Handle Bar Mount

My iON came with the handle bar mount. This works great for attaching the camera
to my motorcycle's handlebars, light bars, and frame.

Here are some pictures of the camera mounted in a couple of different 
locations.

## Cable Tie Mounts

You can also use [Cable Tie Mounts](http://amzn.to/1qk0Zgg) to mount the camera 
to various locations.

## Rubber Band Mount

You can also mount it with rubber bands using the cable tie mounts above.
