Here's a list of budget camping gear to prepare you for motorcycle camping. 
You'll want to keep your gear small. 
When you're searching online, try adding the word "ultralight" to your search
terms. Ultralight gear is used by backpackers 
who prefer to keep their gear as light as possible.

Here are the essentials you'll want to consider for your motorcycle camping 
trip.

## #1 Sleeping Bag

A [20 degree sleeping bag](http://amzn.to/1SbnFeJ) is a nice compromise between 
size and comfort for most motorcycle trips that occur above 30 degrees.

## #2 Sleeping Pad

[Self inflating sleeping pads](http://amzn.to/1SbvPUn) compact down to a smaller 
size but they sometimes need patching. Foam pads a little more bulky and a 
little less comfortable but are also a little more rugged. The 
[Therm-a-Rest Z Lite Sol](http://amzn.to/1Ype6qT) can be folded for easy 
storage on the motorcycle rack or back seat.

## #3 Tarp for Shelter

I use a tarp instead of a tent as a shelter. You'll find a thinner material 
tarp in the camping section at many big box stores. Although it's not as
sturdy, you can can also use a [plastic drop cloth](http://amzn.to/1XqKHMS) as 
a tarp. Another alternative is a heavy duty [poncho](http://amzn.to/1SbvxNt). 
Most of them unbutton and lay 
flat as a rectangle. If you don't think a tarp will be comfortable enough for 
you, check out [one man tents](http://amzn.to/1XqHSeU).

## #4 Head Lamp

A head mounted flashlight comes in handy around camp and for working on your
bike. There are dozens of
different styles of [Head Lamp](http://amzn.to/1ROuuAT) available and many
of them are under $10.

## #5 Esbet Stove

One of the smallest and most convenient stoves. The 
[Esbet Stove](http://amzn.to/1Ypc22j) works great for heating up 
coffee or cooking soup. It's not quite enough power to boil water long enough 
to kill germs, but it's great if you have clean water along the way. If you 
think it might be too small for you, check out other 
[Ultralight Stoves](http://amzn.to/1XqGqZU). Don't forget the matches.

## #6 Hammock

If there are tree's available I've had my most comfortable nights in a 
hammock. I own the [Grand Trunk Ultralight Hammock](http://amzn.to/1SbujS6) and 
love it. Of course there are other [ultralight hammock](http://amzn.to/1XqJ6qv) 
options as well. In cold weather, put your sleeping pad inside your hammock to 
trap warm air and block the cool breeze. In the winter, lay on top of a second
sleeping bag. I once slept in my hammock in a 25 degree winter camp and stayed 
warmer than everyone else in their tents.

## #7 Straps

You'll need some heavy duty straps or rope to hang your hammock. I use 
[cargo lashing straps](http://amzn.to/1Sbwm8R) because they're cheap and 
typically rated for lots of weight. I also picked up a 
[sewing awl](http://amzn.to/1S4WzCZ) and made a loop on one end to 
reduce weight and make setup easier.

## #8 Ground Cover

It's a good idea to have a little bit of ground cover. If you don't have access
to tree's or prefer sleeping on the ground, you'll want something between you
and the dirt. The same tarps and tarp alternatives I listed above work well for 
ground cover too. Bring an extra.

## #9 Duffel Bag

I use an 18" [duffle bag](http://amzn.to/1YprwU1). On my small 250cc motorcycle 
the bag fits perfectly between my seat and the tail light (with the passenger 
seat removed).

## #10 Bungee Chords

An [assortment of bungee chords](http://amzn.to/1Sbvn8O) comes in extremely 
handy for holding things down on your bike and at camp.
