It's date weekend; are you going to dinner or a movie? You've done that a 
million times, why not take a drive instead. A road trip gives you time
to relax, talk, and reflect.

You'll get a chance to get closer and better understand your partner. A drive 
can be one of the best dates and they make for memorable life experiences. It 
doesn't have to be a cross country drive; although it could be. You can go on 
a drive date in as little as 20 minutes.

Here are a few ways a road trip date is a great idea.

## Enjoy Nature

Relax and enjoy the breeze and beautiful nature around you. Take in the colors 
and the atmosphere of the great outdoors around you. Talk about the sights and 
the beauty of this world with your partner. Small teasing and beautiful smiles 
will make it a great road trip. Stop and enjoy by the places that look 
attractive and romantic. Stop at the end of a street or a nearby rest stop and 
watch the dawn or dusk together.

## Listen to Music

Deserts, mountains, crossing state lines, and being out of the city make it easy 
to appreciate good music. Pick some meaningful songs, such as something you 
heard on a first date, or play new music and make new memories. Great music 
improves any road trip. When you crank the tunes, you let your guard down. Let 
go and sing along.

## Take Pictures

You should capture every exciting moment of this adventure trip. Take pictures 
with your date. Use different poses and take pictures at several locations. Snap 
some funny pictures of your partner. Try to capture memories of your date with 
people you meet along the way. You'll enjoy looking back.

A road trip date is a perfect time to spend with your partner. It will bring you 
closer to him/her. It helps to spur conversation your lives. You'll get to know
your partner in a new way.
